### STEP_6_TEST_FILTERS_AND_STATISTICS(NEW)

**Comprehensive testing of filters and statistics with corrected year data**

1. **Test year filter in the web application:**
   - Open the website in a browser
   - Navigate to the filters panel
   - Open the **Year** dropdown
   - Verify years are listed in correct order (not text-sorted)
   - Verify the full range of years is visible (should include years from 1980s-2022)
   - Previously, the user mentioned seeing "years till 2005" - this should now show all years

2. **Test cause filter:**
   - Open the **Cause of Flood** dropdown
   - The user mentioned seeing only "2 causes" but expecting more
   - Verify all unique causes are now visible
   - This issue might have been related to the year sorting affecting filter population

3. **Test combined filtering:**
   - Select a year from the 1980s or 1990s (the problematic range)
   - Verify flood events from that year appear on the map
   - Select a cause filter
   - Verify the combination works correctly
   - Check that the filter count indicator updates properly

4. **Test statistics panel:**
   - Open the statistics panel
   - Verify the **Year Range** displays correctly (e.g., "1985-2022")
   - Previously, text sorting might have shown an incorrect range
   - Verify **Total Events** still shows ~1992 records
   - Check other statistics are calculated correctly

5. **Test year-based queries:**
   Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data integrity:

   ```sql
   -- Count events by decade
   SELECT 
     FLOOR(year / 10) * 10 as decade,
     COUNT(*) as event_count
   FROM floods
   WHERE year IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY FLOOR(year / 10) * 10
   ORDER BY decade DESC;
   
   -- Verify records exist across the full time range
   SELECT 
     MIN(year) as earliest_year,
     MAX(year) as latest_year,
     COUNT(*) as total_records,
     COUNT(DISTINCT year) as unique_years
   FROM floods
   WHERE year IS NOT NULL;
   
   -- Check if the "missing" years are now accessible
   SELECT year, COUNT(*) as count
   FROM floods
   WHERE year > 2005
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year;
   ```

6. **Verify the original issue is resolved:**
   - **Original problem:** "I see 2 causes and the years till 2005 but I know that I have records with more"
   - **Expected after fix:** All causes should be visible, and years beyond 2005 should appear in filters
   - The TEXT sorting was likely causing the filter population logic to miss certain values
   - With INTEGER sorting, the `_getUniqueValuesWithCount` method in `static/app.js` should now capture all unique values correctly

7. **Test edge cases:**
   - Filter by the earliest year in the dataset
   - Filter by the latest year in the dataset
   - Filter by years in the problematic ID range (1885-1994)
   - Verify all filters return the expected results
   - Test clearing filters and reapplying them

**Success criteria:**
- Year dropdown shows all years from the dataset in correct numeric order
- Cause dropdown shows all unique causes (more than 2)
- Years beyond 2005 are visible and selectable
- Statistics show correct year range
- Map displays flood events correctly for all year selections
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
