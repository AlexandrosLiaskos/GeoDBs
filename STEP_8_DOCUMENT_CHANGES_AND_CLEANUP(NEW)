### STEP_8_DOCUMENT_CHANGES_AND_CLEANUP(NEW)

**Document the fix and clean up temporary investigation files**

1. **Update project documentation:**
   - Consider adding a note in `README.md` about the year field data type
   - Document the migration that was performed
   - Add a troubleshooting entry about data type issues
   - Example section to add:
     ```markdown
     ## Data Type Corrections
     
     ### Year Field Migration (2025-10-21)
     The `year` column was originally created as TEXT, causing incorrect sorting behavior.
     It has been migrated to INTEGER for proper numeric sorting and filtering.
     
     If you encounter sorting issues with other fields, verify their data types in
     `db/migrations/supabase_schema.sql` and ensure numeric fields use appropriate types.
     ```

2. **Clean up temporary investigation files:**
   - Delete the investigation files created in the previous troubleshooting session:
     - `INVESTIGATION_STEP_1_SUPABASE_DATA_VERIFICATION`
     - `INVESTIGATION_STEP_2_RLS_POLICY_VERIFICATION`
     - `INVESTIGATION_STEP_3_MIGRATION_VERIFICATION`
     - `INVESTIGATION_STEP_4_FRONTEND_DEBUGGING`
     - `INVESTIGATION_STEP_5_DATA_QUALITY_ANALYSIS`
     - `RESOLUTION_OPTION_1_RE_MIGRATE_DATA`
     - `RESOLUTION_OPTION_2_FIX_DATA_QUALITY`
     - `RESOLUTION_OPTION_3_FIX_RLS_POLICIES`
     - `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST`
   - These were helpful for investigation but are no longer needed

3. **Clean up the current step files:**
   - After completing all steps, delete the STEP_* files created during this fix:
     - `STEP_1_BACKUP_AND_VERIFY_DATA(NEW)`
     - `STEP_2_CLEAN_INVALID_YEAR_DATA(NEW)`
     - `STEP_3_ALTER_COLUMN_TYPE_IN_SUPABASE(NEW)`
     - `STEP_4_VERIFY_FRONTEND_COMPATIBILITY(NEW)`
     - `STEP_5_VERIFY_SORTING_IN_SUPABASE(NEW)`
     - `STEP_6_TEST_FILTERS_AND_STATISTICS(NEW)`
     - `STEP_7_OPTIONAL_CHECK_OTHER_NUMERIC_FIELDS(NEW)`
     - `STEP_8_DOCUMENT_CHANGES_AND_CLEANUP(NEW)`
   - Or keep them in a `docs/migrations/` folder for historical reference

4. **Commit changes to version control:**
   ```bash
   git add db/migrations/supabase_schema.sql
   git commit -m "Fix: Change year column from TEXT to INTEGER for correct sorting
   
   - Updated supabase_schema.sql to define year as INTEGER
   - Resolves issue where years were sorting lexicographically (1995 > 2022)
   - Records from ID 1885-1994 now sort correctly by year
   - No frontend changes required - JavaScript handles both types"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Verify GitHub Pages deployment (if applicable):**
   - If using GitHub Pages deployment (as mentioned in `README.md`)
   - The schema change only affects Supabase, not the deployed frontend
   - No redeployment is needed
   - The frontend will automatically use the corrected data type from Supabase

6. **Create a backup of the corrected database:**
   - Export the floods table again as CSV
   - Save as `floods_corrected_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
   - This serves as a reference point after the fix
   - Compare with the backup from STEP_1 to verify no data loss

7. **Final verification checklist:**
   - [ ] Year column is INTEGER in Supabase
   - [ ] Schema file updated to reflect INTEGER type
   - [ ] Sorting works correctly in Supabase Table Editor
   - [ ] Frontend filters show all years and causes
   - [ ] Statistics display correct year range
   - [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
   - [ ] All 1992 records are still present
   - [ ] Changes committed to version control
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Temporary files cleaned up
