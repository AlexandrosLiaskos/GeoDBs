### STEP_7_OPTIONAL_CHECK_OTHER_NUMERIC_FIELDS(NEW)

**Optional: Review other TEXT fields that might benefit from numeric types**

While fixing the year field, consider whether other fields have similar issues:

1. **Review the schema in `db/migrations/supabase_schema.sql`:**
   - Line 22: `deaths_toll TEXT` - might be better as INTEGER if it contains only numbers
   - Line 25: `rainfall_height TEXT` - might be better as NUMERIC/DECIMAL if it contains measurements
   - Line 23: `rainfall_duration TEXT` - might contain numeric values with units

2. **Check data in these fields:**
   ```sql
   -- Check deaths_toll values
   SELECT DISTINCT deaths_toll 
   FROM floods 
   WHERE deaths_toll IS NOT NULL AND deaths_toll != ''
   ORDER BY deaths_toll
   LIMIT 50;
   
   -- Check rainfall_height values
   SELECT DISTINCT rainfall_height 
   FROM floods 
   WHERE rainfall_height IS NOT NULL AND rainfall_height != ''
   ORDER BY rainfall_height
   LIMIT 50;
   
   -- Check rainfall_duration values
   SELECT DISTINCT rainfall_duration 
   FROM floods 
   WHERE rainfall_duration IS NOT NULL AND rainfall_duration != ''
   ORDER BY rainfall_duration
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

3. **Determine if conversion is needed:**
   
   **Convert to numeric IF:**
   - Values are purely numeric (e.g., "5", "10", "25")
   - You need to perform numeric operations (sum, average, comparison)
   - Sorting should be numeric (e.g., 5 < 10 < 25, not "10" < "25" < "5")
   
   **Keep as TEXT IF:**
   - Values contain units (e.g., "5 hours", "10mm", "25 people")
   - Values contain ranges (e.g., "5-10", "10-15")
   - Values contain text (e.g., "Unknown", "N/A", "Several")
   - Values are inconsistently formatted

4. **If conversion is beneficial:**
   - Follow the same process as the year field (STEP_1 through STEP_3)
   - Clean data first, then alter column type
   - Update the schema file
   - Test the frontend

5. **Recommendation:**
   - **DO NOT** change these fields unless the user reports issues with them
   - The year field was causing a specific sorting problem that the user noticed
   - Other fields may intentionally be TEXT to accommodate varied data formats
   - Changing them without understanding the data could cause issues
   - Only proceed if you verify the data is purely numeric and would benefit from type conversion

**Note:** This step is optional and should only be performed if:
- The user reports similar issues with other fields
- You've verified the data is purely numeric
- You have a clear use case for numeric operations on these fields
