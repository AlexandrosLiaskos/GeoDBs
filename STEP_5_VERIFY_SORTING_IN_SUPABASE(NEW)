### STEP_5_VERIFY_SORTING_IN_SUPABASE(NEW)

**Verify that the sorting issue is resolved in Supabase Table Editor**

This step confirms the original issue reported by the user is fixed:

1. **Test sorting in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → floods table
   - Click on the **year** column header to sort
   - Click again to toggle between ascending and descending

2. **Verify correct sorting behavior:**
   
   **Ascending sort (oldest to newest):**
   - Should show years like: 1985, 1986, 1987, ..., 2020, 2021, 2022
   - Records from ID 1885-1994 should appear in their correct chronological position
   - NOT: 2005, 2010, 2022, 1985, 1990, 1995 (old TEXT sorting)

   **Descending sort (newest to oldest):**
   - Should show years like: 2022, 2021, 2020, ..., 1987, 1986, 1985
   - Newest records should appear first
   - Oldest records should appear last

3. **Specifically check the problematic records:**
   - Filter or search for records with ID between 1885 and 1994
   - Note their year values
   - Verify they now sort correctly relative to other records
   - Previously, these records appeared as "latest" when sorting by year

4. **Run verification queries:**
   ```sql
   -- Get records in correct year order
   SELECT id, year, location_name, date_of_commencement
   FROM floods
   WHERE year IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY year DESC
   LIMIT 50;
   
   -- Verify the problematic ID range now sorts correctly
   SELECT id, year, location_name
   FROM floods
   WHERE id >= 1885 AND id <= 1994
   ORDER BY year DESC;
   
   -- Check year distribution (should be in numeric order)
   SELECT year, COUNT(*) as count
   FROM floods
   WHERE year IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year DESC;
   ```

5. **Compare with original issue:**
   - **Before fix:** Sorting by year showed 2005, 2010, 2022, then 1985, 1990, 1995 (text sorting)
   - **After fix:** Sorting by year shows 2022, 2021, 2020, ..., 1995, 1990, 1985 (numeric sorting)
   - Records after ID 1884 should no longer appear as "latest"

6. **Document the fix:**
   - Take screenshots of the corrected sorting in Supabase
   - Note the year range now displays correctly
   - Confirm all 1992 records are still present (no data loss)
   - Verify the two causes mentioned by the user are still visible in filters
